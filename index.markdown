## Preparation
You'll need three players and a standard 52-card deck.
1. Shuffle the deck, then deal 28 cards into 4 columns, 7 cards each. Turn over the bottom card of each column.
2. Each player draws 8 cards from the remaining deck. The game begins in turn order.

## Rules
On your turn, you can perform one of the following actions:
1. Place a card from your hand at the bottom of any column.
2. Move a sequence of cards from the bottom of one column to the bottom of another.
    * The sequence must be in descending order.
    * The top card of the sequence must be lower than the bottom card of the destination column.

## Note
1. After any move, if the bottom card of a column is face-down, flip it face-up.
2. If a full descending sequence from K to A appears in a column, remove it from play.
    * If all cards in the sequence share the same suit, you earn 1 point.
3. The game ends when all cards are cleared or the countdown timer reaches zero.

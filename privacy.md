### iOS App - *Lone Fondness*
The app collects **no personal data**, displays **no advertisements**, and requires **no account** to play.

All gameplay takes place on a public or self-hosted server of your choice. No tracking is performed, and no analytics are embedded.

### Private Server Program - *lfserver*
If you choose to host your own server, we make the following guarantees:

- **The private server program is identical to the public server.** No differences in functionality or behavior.
- **The program is resource-efficient.** It is designed to use minimal CPU, memory, and bandwidth.
- **No user data is collected or transmitted.** You retain full control over your hosted environment.

## 🖥️ What is a game server?

In an online game, a **central coordination server** is used to synchronize game state between players.  
By default, *Lone Fondness* uses public servers maintained by us. However, you can also host your own **private server** for more control and a smoother connection.

## ❓ Why run a private server?

1. ⚠️ **Better connectivity** — While we provide public servers across several continents, some users may experience high latency or unreachable networks due to local restrictions.
2. 💡 **Guaranteed availability** — Public servers have limited computing resources. During peak hours, you may not be able to create a new game.
3. 🛠️ **Full control** — A private server gives you stable performance, faster response time, and a self-managed environment with no dependency on our infrastructure.

## ⚙️ How to set up a private server

### Step 1: Run the server

Download the server binary for your platform, extract it, and run the executable:

```bash
# extract
tar xzf lfserver-1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
# run
./lfserver-1.0-linux-amd64
```

> ✅ The server runs with no configuration on supported platforms.  
> Supported architectures: **Linux x86_64 (amd64)** and **Linux ARM64**.

### Step 2: Connect from the app

On the game’s **main screen**, click the pot icon to access the server list.

- Enter your server’s IP address or domain name.
- Then **select it as your active server** before creating or joining any game.

> ❗ **Important:** Every player in the same game must connect to the **same private server**.  
> If even one player uses a different server, the game will fail to start.
